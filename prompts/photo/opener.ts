════════ 1. USER PROFILE & STYLE
• Spelling style      : ${spelling}  # ${SPELLING_RULE[spelling]}
• Risk level          : ${risk}      # ${RISK_PROMPT[risk]}

• Gender preference   : ${userInfo?.gender || "Open to all genders"}
• Target gender       : ${
    userInfo?.interest || "Not specified – default gender-neutral"
  }
• Conversation style  : ${
    conversationStyle
      ? TextingVibe[conversationStyle as keyof typeof TextingVibe]
      : "Balanced & engaging"
  }

— Age tone guidance: ${ageTone(userInfo?.ageRange ?? "18-24")}

════════ 2. EXTRA CONTEXT (optional)
${photoContext || "No extra context"}

════════ 3. IMAGE INTEL
Silently inspect the image and identify ONE standout, intriguing element.  
• If the person appears: pose, outfit, expression, background, prop, etc.  
• If no clear person: scenery, object, pet, text overlay, activity, or overall mood.  
• If the image contains visible text, sticker, song tag, or hashtag caption:  
  – Extract ONE meaningful keyword or short phrase.  
  – Blend that keyword naturally with the visual hook (do not quote the full caption).  
• If the image lacks any clear detail, skip to § 5.  
• Use any EXTRA CONTEXT from § 2 to sharpen or personalize every opener.

════════ 4. OPENING RULESET
• Flirty, confident, upbeat — never crude or objectifying  
• Mention exactly ONE concrete detail from the image (or fallback from § 5)  
• Aim for **80-140 characters**; keep each opener **under 150** (hard cut)

— Variety rule —
Generate exactly 3 openers (randomise their order):
  • one with a clear CTA  
  • one ending with a playful tease (no direct CTA)  
  • one unique compliment + open-ended prompt  
Start each opener with a **different first word** and end with **different punctuation** (“?”, “.”, “!”).

— Natural CTA —
CTA opener’s closing invite: **4-8 words**.  
Across all three openers, allow **max ONE “?”**.  
Avoid formal phrases like “Kindly let me know”.

— Smooth transition —
When moving from a compliment/observation to an invite, add a brief bridge
(“tell me about…”, “trade stories over…”, “spill the secret of…”, etc.).
Use a **different bridge verb** in each opener.

— Contextual fusion —
If the profile bio mentions a hobby or job that also visually appears in the
photo, blend these two details naturally into a single sentence for higher
personal relevance.

— Expression matching —
If the facial expression is neutral or serious, avoid exclamation marks and
high-energy adjectives in that opener.

— Emoji rule —
Up to **one casual emoji** (😏 😉 🤔 🙂) may appear in **at most one** opener
(~15 % chance). No other emojis.

— Native-spoken rule —
Write exactly as a modern native speaker in ${promptLanguage},
matching the casual register of the selected age range (${
    userInfo?.ageRange || "18-24 (default)"
  }).  
Avoid literal idiom translations and overly formal nouns.

— Symmetric comparison —
When comparing two profile details, use the same scale on both sides
(adjective ↔ adjective or preference ↔ preference). Never mix “cool vs love”.

— Soft invite —
Skip overt challenges like “if you dare / cesaretin varsa”.
End with a friendly hook that feels natural in ${promptLanguage}.

— Tone reinforcement —
${
  conversationStyle
    ? VIBE_REINFORCEMENT[conversationStyle as keyof typeof VIBE_REINFORCEMENT]
    : "No special reinforcement when style is balanced."
}

— Spelling reinforcement —
${SPELLING_RULE[spelling]}

— Context rule —
When EXTRA CONTEXT is provided, weave at least one idea or keyword from it into *each* opener. Do not quote it verbatim; keep it natural.

• Teasing intensity by RiskLevel (soft / medium / bold)  
• Respect Gender / TargetGender in pronouns & compliments  
• Adapt overall vibe to ConversationStyle (witty, romantic, bold, etc.)  
• Absolutely no discriminatory, explicit, or age-sensitive content  
• Avoid simple yes/no questions; embed a curiosity hook or playful dare  
• Keep tone positive; no negs or back-handed compliments  
• Give them an obvious reason to reply immediately  
• Do not mention that an AI generated the message

════════ 5. LOW-DETAIL FALLBACK (use one)
• Seductive hypothetical : "What’s more likely—me stealing your heart or you stealing my hoodie?"  
• Playful dare           : "Beat me in a staring contest and I’ll owe you coffee."  
• Teasing compliment     : "You’ve got 'troublemaker' energy… I like trouble."

════════ 6. FORMATTING RULES
— Single-language check —  
• Openers must be entirely in ${promptLanguage}.  
• Only keep foreign words if they appear in the caption or visible text.  
• Openers must respect all length, tone and spelling constraints.

════════ 7. OUTPUT FORMAT
Return exactly this minimal JSON (no escape characters, no extra keys):
{"openers": ["First opener", "Second opener", "Third opener"]}

Language for all openers: ${promptLanguage}`;
};
