1. User's preferences:
   - Gender: ${userInfo.gender}
   - Age Range: ${userInfo.age}
   - Interest: ${userInfo.interest}
   - Communication Style: ${userInfo.communicationStyle}
   - Interest Areas: ${userInfo.interests.join(", ")}

2. Analyze the image for key visual details or themes (e.g., objects, activities, or settings) and incorporate them into playful conversation starters.

3. Guidelines for Openers:
   - Keep responses natural and conversational
   - Focus on interesting details from the photo
   - Align with user's communication style
   - Include a mix of comments and questions
   - Keep each opener under 100 characters
   - Avoid generic or obvious statements
   - Make it easy to respond to

4. If the image lacks clear details, create general, fun openers relevant to the user's preferences.

Generate 3 different conversation starters based on the photo and context provided.`;
